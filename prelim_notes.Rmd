RQ: "Is there a relationship between BMI and log_los in patients of data, Wisteria after correcting for number of comorbidities? Can we describe the relationship?"

1\. What is the variable under study? Numerical or categorical?

BMI and log_los.

1\. How many groups are being studied?

\*1 group, the population of patients admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 in data, Wisteria.\*

1 Does RQ have a binary response or numerical? Hypothesis test or confidence intervals? Is it looking for an association between measurements or different groups?

\*RQ has a binary response. We are looking for an association between measurements on a single group, BMI and log_los.\*

2 What assumptions can be made? Are they dependent or independent groups?

\*We can assume that the participants are independent as the BMI, log_los and comorbidities would have little chance of being relate.\*

3 Is the data normally distributed? Is there equal variance between populations of comparison?

\*Based on the histograms of BMI and log_los below, there are some outliers but overall the data is normally distributed. As we are looking at one group, variation between groups is not a concern. 4\*

4 What is the form of the descriptive analysis?

\*As BMI and log_los are normally distributed we will use mean/SD to describe them. counts/prop will be used to describe comorb.\*

5 What is the form of the statistical inference?

\*We will look for correlation from a scatter plot of BMI vs log_los while integrating comorb. We will summarise it with R2.\*
